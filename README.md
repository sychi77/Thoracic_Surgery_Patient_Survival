# Thoracic Surgery for Lung Cancer Data Set
 From [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Thoracic+Surgery+Data "UCI ML Repository: Thoracic Surgery Data Set")

### Main

The Jupyter notebook [ThoracicSurgery](https://github.com/sychi77/CapstoneProject1/blob/master/ThoracicSurgery.ipynb "ThoracicSurgery Jupyter Notebook") contains the main report.

### Abstract

The data is dedicated to the classification problem related to the post-operative life expectancy in the lung cancer patients: class 1 - death within one year after surgery, class 2 - survival.


### Data Set Information

The data was collected retrospectively at Wroclaw Thoracic Surgery Centre for patients who underwent major lung resections for primary lung cancer in the years 2007-2011. The Centre is associated with the Department of Thoracic Surgery of the Medical University of Wroclaw and Lower-Silesian Centre for Pulmonary Diseases, Poland, while the research database constitutes a part of the National Lung Cancer Registry, administered by the Institute of Tuberculosis and Pulmonary Diseases in Warsaw, Poland.

The data folder contains the original data file in CSV format, converted from Weka ARFF. 
The *Data_Wrangling* Jupyter notebook file shows how I changed the original data set into the one used for this project.
